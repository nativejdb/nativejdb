/**
 * Defines that the annotated class should have a Hybrid layout. Hybrid layouts are hybrids between
 * instance layouts and array layouts. The contents of a specified member array and (optional)
 * member type id slots are directly placed within the class layout. This saves one indirection when
 * accessing the array or type id slots.
 *
 * <p>
 * The array length is located directly after the HUB pointer, like in regular array. Then (if
 * present) the type id slots follow. Then the instance fields are placed. Then, with the default
 * GC, there is an optional identity hashcode. At the end of the layout, the array elements are
 * located.
