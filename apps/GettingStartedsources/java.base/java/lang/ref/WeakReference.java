 * Weak reference objects, which do not prevent their referents from being

 * reachable</a>.  At that time it will atomically clear all weak references to
 * that object and all weak references to any other weakly-reachable objects
 * from which that object is reachable through a chain of strong and soft
 * references.  At the same time it will declare all of the formerly
 * weakly-reachable objects to be finalizable.  At the same time or at some
 * later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared weak references that are
 * registered with reference queues.
