         * Invokes a static method.
         * The method must not be a static initializer.
         * The method must be a member of the interface type.
         * <p>Since JDWP version 1.8
         * <p>
         * The method invocation will occur in the specified thread.
         * Method invocation can occur only if the specified thread
         * has been suspended by an event.
         * Method invocation is not supported
         * when the target VM has been suspended by the front-end.
         * <p>
         * The specified method is invoked with the arguments in the specified
         * argument list.
         * The method invocation is synchronous; the reply packet is not
         * sent until the invoked method returns in the target VM.
         * The return value (possibly the void value) is
         * included in the reply packet.
         * If the invoked method throws an exception, the
         * exception object ID is set in the reply packet; otherwise, the
         * exception object ID is null.
         * <p>
         * For primitive arguments, the argument value's type must match the
         * argument's type exactly. For object arguments, there must exist a
         * widening reference conversion from the argument value's type to the
         * argument's type and the argument's type must be loaded.
         * <p>
         * By default, all threads in the target VM are resumed while
         * the method is being invoked if they were previously
         * suspended by an event or by a command.
         * This is done to prevent the deadlocks
         * that will occur if any of the threads own monitors
         * that will be needed by the invoked method. It is possible that
         * breakpoints or other events might occur during the invocation.
         * Note, however, that this implicit resume acts exactly like
         * the ThreadReference resume command, so if the thread's suspend
         * count is greater than 1, it will remain in a suspended state
         * during the invocation. By default, when the invocation completes,
         * all threads in the target VM are suspended, regardless their state
         * before the invocation.
         * <p>
         * The resumption of other threads during the invoke can be prevented
         * by specifying the INVOKE_SINGLE_THREADED
         * bit flag in the <code>options</code> field; however,
         * there is no protection against or recovery from the deadlocks
         * described above, so this option should be used with great caution.
         * Only the specified thread will be resumed (as described for all
         * threads above). Upon completion of a single threaded invoke, the invoking thread
         * will be suspended once again. Note that any threads started during
         * the single threaded invocation will not be suspended when the
         * invocation completes.
         * <p>
         * If the target VM is disconnected during the invoke (for example, through
         * the VirtualMachine dispose command) the method invocation continues.
